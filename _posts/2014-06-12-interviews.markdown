I have been interviewing for a job for a while now and I've had some good experiences
and some _extremely_ ridiculous ones. Pardon me if I'm being vague but you have to understand
the need to be ambiguous. Also, I'm not a CS major. Lets recap:

* Interview at a startup - Lets just say, these guys are new - *very* new. After the first
15 minutes of of trying to convince him of the correctness of my logic, I realised Interviewer
did not want to understand my logic, he wanted me to say the exact words/logic he had looked up.
I don't feel bad about this one one bit!

Moving on,

* A prominent technology company - Interviewed me at one of their innumerable offices
in an Indian city. I was quite excited. I had interviewed with them for my campus placements
but the pain from my ripped toe nail was way too much for me to answer a simple question.
It was time to prove my mettle. There were 3, maybe 4 - I do not recollect - but what I
distinctly remember was being grilled by my last but one interviewer about the _weirdest_
things. I remember thinking to myself, "__How__ in the world is any of this relevant to my job?!".
Also, every interviewer did not seem to know what the other had asked me so I ended up explaining
polymorphism 4 times. There seemed to be a genuine lack of quality questions. Now you might be wondering,
"This guy can't get a job and he's out to judge?". Well, I am a good sport. I know when I hear a good question.
When a question stumps me, I accept my pitfall and ensure I grok so enough of it and a bit more so that next time I'm prepared.
Result of interview? Lets just say I'm _waiting_.

Moving on,

* A very sought after Tech MNC - This place is recommended by academia! Beat that! And
I must say when I got their first email, I was taken aback. The quality of the coding
assignment was out of this world! Several other people later agreed. I got the code
out on time, well tested and all that. I used proper TDD. Review took a while but they
did like it. A genuinely good telephonic interview later, I was called in for a bunch of face to face rounds.
Gah! A really early morning flight and long bus ride later, I reached their office. I had to wait a bit but I was okay
 with it. I needed some time to compose myself. I was made to pair program with this one
of their engineers. I killed it. I flew through the design question round. Then...it happened.
 First it started with the interviewer wanting to __mould__ his question into mine. I corrected him
and asked him if he meant to ask me a simple "I want to count the number of occurrences of a word in a book"
Map-Reduce question. He went ahead and said yes; in retrospect I may have hurt him here. The
second interviewer went onto tries. I announced I haven't worked on tries but I was willing to give it a shot.
I admit my fault here - I drew the trie upside-down. When the second interviewer saw this, he asked if the first interviewer would like to help me out a bit.
Much to my horror and slight irritation, he replied, "I stopped listening to him." Now lets take a step back here
and review what I just heard. The __interviewer__ stopped listening to the __interviewee__. Anyway, I tried to hide my annoyance and move on.
The second guy was very helpful and kept trying. Then he got cut off because the first guy wanted to know about trigram indexes + levenshtein distances.
Mind you I didn't know the last bit. This is something I read recently. Anyway, the point was the first guy actually thought I was being asked an
"autocorrect" question instead of the actual "autocomplete" question. Much to his embarrassment he was corrected by his colleague. This is where he lost it.
 And I had already sensed my interview had gone for a toss! I was one round away from landing a dream job and I had messed it up.
 I was asked, "What is NodeJS?". Now I'm not Node expert. I had read about it but I didn't know people judged someone's technical expertise on definitions.
I said what came to my mind, "Its fast". Not a lie! "Why is it fast?". "Cause its written in Javascript". Not a lie again! Yes its the event loop and its the Chrome V8 engine but really?
This is where it went out of control. I said something stupid about Javascript - "Javascript is a functional programming language". "Are you sure? Why do you say so?". "Cause functions are first class
citizens in JS". "And?". "And I don't know"."What are the functional programming principles?". Really? I was remembering Prof. Martin Odersky teaching this on Coursera. Sorry Professor if I disappointed you.
"Okay tell me what is a function?". "Uh. Its a mapping from one set to another set?". Again, what is going on here?! "What is a relation? Whats the difference?". Really? REALLY? I can ask you whats the
difference between perturbation theory and Hartree-Flock Self Consistancy Field Method and you wouldn't know, but then again, I don't expect you to. I had given up by now.
He went on to ask me if he can ask me questions on Operating Systems to which I respectfully said I haven't done the course (Please read my resume). Mind you by now the second guy was busy chatting with someone on his
swank iPhone. I was done. Luckily they called it a day to and the verdict was obvious. Now I don't say I didn't make mistakes, I did. But that one guy made sure he rubbed each and every one in my face.
That single interviewer killed the respect I had built up for the company, from reading articles by their chief scientist, to regularly keeping up to date with their Git repository.
 I wouldn't interview again at this place.

Moving on,

* I was recently took a test given to me by a prominent banking firm. In this test I was asked some the most farfetched details
 of some Java libraries. I have worked with Java for a while. I have shipped production Java code but I do know enough to get me by.
 I had read up on the topic they asked for during my training at my previous firm but I found it amazing that I was expected to remember it all!
  I still wait to hear from them but then again I won't be surprised if, I didn't have enough "_experience_".

I could go on and on because I have given a whole lot of interviews as you must have realised by now but I don't see the point of making it a rant.
 Its not a rant. If you feel it is, I'm sorry if I made it feel that way. This post is only to drive a point home. Please don't judge my technical aptitude on
some obscure question that might have taken you a months to fish out. Ask me something that tests my logic and aptitude to grasp new technology.
I have picked up AngularJS, Scala, Ruby, Golang, Objective-C and a bit of Python. I know and have worked with C, C# and Java extensively. I find Swift a lot like Scala but I haven't read too much on it that I can say with confidence that I can code in Swift.
 I even took part in Stripe's CTF 3.0 on a whim and got to the last but one level. I certainly don't lack the skills to
 learn new things but if you expect me to rote something and spit it out day after day, I'm not your person and I'm okay with that.

To all the people reading this, please read these wise words of [Alex MacCaw](http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/the-state-of-hiring). I hope it does you some good.

Also, this tweet caught my eye on [Andy Lindeman's](http://www.andylindeman.com/about.html) page. I'll leave it at that.
